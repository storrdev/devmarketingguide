# Community Projects

# and Retargeting

[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/john-sheehan.png)][0]

John Sheehan is the co-founder & CEO of [Runscope][1]. He knows firsthand how to get developers engaged and how to drive grassroots adoption of developer products; he led developer evangelism at [Twilio][2] and API/Platform at [IFTTT][3].

## What makes a site popular?

* No sign-up: the faster the consumer can get to the product, the better
* Does one thing well: as opposed to a million things not so well
* It's free: who doesn't love free stuff?

## Community Projects

"We have had a really good run of success with these, so we are constantly on the look out for new community projects," Sheehan says.

#### Example Community Projects

* [Devco Jobs][4] \[Heavybit\]
* [Postgres Guide][5] \[Heroku\]
* [Java is Cool][6] \[Takipi\]
* [12 Factor][7] \[Heroku\]
* [Hurl.it][8] \[Runscope\]
* [RequestBin][9] \[Runscope\]
* [Open Source Email Templates][10] \[Sendwithus\]

#### Still not convinced?

In this video, Meghan Murphy of Twilio illustrates the ["ROI of Community."][11]

Here's more from Sheehan on the marketing impact of [others using your community products & services.][12]

## Retargeting

"Our community projects refer, between direct, organic referrals and retargeting, about 33% of our sign-ups for an average cost per acquisition for retargeting of about 2 dollars... I consider this roughly like free sign-ups."

Retargeting in action:

> Nice. [@johnsheehan][0] is retargeting. You found me! (Ads) cool ad John. //cc [@runscope][13] [pic.twitter.com/ycPalb7t0q][14]--- Donn Felker (@donnfelker) [August 11, 2013][15]

#### Retargeting with Email

Retargetted ads are just one way of engaging users who have dropped off.
Alex Schultz, VP of Growth at Facebook, has a [great talk][16] where he discusses
strategies for growing engagement and fighting churn. One of the choice quotes:

> The most effective email you can do is notifications.
> --- Alex Schultz

Sendwithus has a [guide to Re-Engagement Emails][17] that covers how to use notifications and other emails for retargetting.

#### Retargeting Tools

John uses [Perfect Audience][18], but there are plenty of other options. The top retargeting services are [AdRoll][19], [Chango][20], [Triggit][21], and [ReTargeter][22]
