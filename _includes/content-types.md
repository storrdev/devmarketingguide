Danielle Morrill joined Twilio in 2009 as Director of Marketing as the community grew from a few hundred developers to more than 100,000 members. She is currently the co-founder & CEO of Mattermark.

During her Heavybit Speaker Series presentation, Morrill touts the advantages of simple yet effective marketing tools. "These are all organic things that you do that don't cost you anything other than time," she says.

## Get a Newsletter

Email might not be the most attractive means of communication, but newsletters are direct and exclusive to customers, a good starting point. "You should have an email newsletter if you have nothing else... This is the one opportunity you have to make something just for them that no one else consumes."

#### SOME POPULAR NEWSLETTER TOOLS

* [Mailchimp][1]
* [Active Campaign][2]
* [Benchmark Email][3]
* [Feedblitz][4]
* [Sailthru][5]

## Email drip campaigns

"You should have an email drip campaign, even if it's just, 'Hi, thanks for signing up.'"

#### DO

* You may want to manually send drip emails to new users, until you have a good idea of what sort of emails to send. You can read more about setting up a drip campaign in the [Sendwithus Guide to Onboarding Emails][6].
* Automate the drip campaign in advance. Here's an example from [MailChimp][7].
* Test your emails. Get as many people on your team to read them as possible before pressing that final button.
* Make sure your emails look pretty. There are a few good options for responsive email templates:
  * [Open Source Email Templates][8] \[Sendwithus\]
  * [Ink Responsive Email Framework][9] \[Zurb\]
  * [Transactional Email Templates][10] \[Mailgun\]

#### DON'T

* Send too many emails. You don't want to clog anyone's inbox.
* End up in a spam filter. One way to do this is by avoiding certain words in your subject line. [Here's a great list from Hubspot][11]
* Forget to authenticate your sending domain. You'll need to setup [DKIM, SPF, and DMARC][12]

## Fancy a blog?

A blog is a good idea if you know you will be able to maintain it. "You could post once a month," Morrill says. "Just post." Content can range from contests to documentation where you can describe the product. "A great product is great marketing." These documentation pages may be the most visited on your site.

## Link to your own content

Social media is not necessarily marketing. It can be ineffective, especially if you are linking to third-party sites. Remember to focus on your own product and content. "Every single one of those tweets is a missed opportunity to link to your great content."

## Get your product listed

Product listing sites like [stackshare][15], [GetApp][16], [Capterra, [Product Hunt][18], [Slant][19] and [G2 Crowd][20] provide lasting results with minimal effort. Developers are highly informed and proactive about finding the most powerful tools to compliment their trait. By listing your product you're able to get in-front of developers who are actively looking for new tools, create a place where users can submit meaningful reviews and gain a powerful back-link which will help you climb SERP ladder.][17]
